<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">This project aims to explain the task of keeping current date and time of the system .To produce a robust-designed of digital clock. Gives full functional statements to the management of the User. The purpose of this project is to present a general approach to result a accurate date and time.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="5">OBJECTIVES:<br>
The aim of the project is to design a twelve hour Digital Clock that displays the time digitally, in contrast to an analog clock, where the time is indicated by the positions of rotating hands. With the help of counters and decoders, a digital clock to display time in hours, minutes and seconds can be constructed</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="35">STRENGTH:<br>
• It aims to simplify the task of Showing a accurate result• Simple &amp; Easy to Use<br>
WEAKNESS:<br>
•It is not completely encrypted<br>
OPPURTUNITIES:<br>
In future,more Data such as temprature can be added apart from the ones which are used here in this project.<br>
THREATS:<br>
Company now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some companies don’t have the right data encryption practices in place. This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable by criminals.<br>
